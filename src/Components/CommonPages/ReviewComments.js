                        It was amazing learning experience with Dr. Faisal sir. Dr. Faisal saifee helped me personally to making a protocol for cognitive therapy in very easy way without any heavy concepts and theory it was very helpful to me an patient as well so Thanku sir and congratulations for your valuable guidance.
                        <br />

                        It's has really helped me alot and showed me about the concepts I should be focusing on, try to be best in,and getting more into detailed analysis of small things.
                        Technique of teaching by sir helped us to  get the  best direction of thinking and work as that and many more it's really fun and completely knowledgeable sessions with sir and looking forward for more such sessions.

                        It have really helped me in thinking in different perspective and think more about one concepts and utilise small things in making big differences ,sir have showed the way to see all other sides of one thing and later choose best one to use it for better results.

                        Many concepts taught by Dr. Faisal during our training sessions our useful in our day to day practice. For example: Importance of eccentric training, core and trunk stabilizing exercises for SCI patients, variations of VMO and Heel slides which are way more effective than our mainstream exercises.
